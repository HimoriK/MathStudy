# MathStudy

Info on resources for studying math, repurposed.

I created this list for my own studies. I haven't read most of the books here yet, and probably never will read most of them. 

Keep in mind that I'm not very familiar with some of these subjects. I usually start out collecting a bunch of titles, then organize them as I begin to find a typical sequence of study to proceed.

I hope to make the list more complete in the future, but for now, there are some subjects that are left out for no good reason. 

## Sections

Break the list up into more manageable chunks.

### [Geometry and Topology](GeomTopo.md)

## Annotations

[I've stopped bothering with this, since now I just link to Amazon or other listings for the books where you can see prices.]

- (f) - This book is available free online.
