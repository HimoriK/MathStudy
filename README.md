# MathStudy

Info on resources for studying math, stats, CS, etc.

I created this list for my own studies. I haven't read most of the books here yet, and probably never will read most of them. 

Keep in mind that I'm not very familiar with some of these subjects, so my organization might not make any sense. I usually start out by just collecting a bunch of titles, then I organize them as I begin to figure out how a typical sequence of study in that subfield should proceed.

I hope to make the list more complete in the future, but for now, there are some subjects that are left out for no good reason. 

## Sections

break the list up into more manageable chunks.

### [Calculus](Calculus.md)
### [Analysis](Analysis.md)
### [Probability, Statistics and Machine Learning](ProbStats.md)
### [Linear Algebra](LinearAlgebra.md)
### [Algebra](Algebra.md)
### [Geometry and Topology](GeomTopo.md)
### [Logic and Discrete Math](LogicDiscrete.md)
### [Computer Science](CS.md)
### [School level (pre-calculus) mathematics](SchoolLevel.md)
### [Sciences](Sciences.md)

## Annotations

[I've stopped bothering with this, since now I just link to Amazon or other listings for the books where you can see prices.]
